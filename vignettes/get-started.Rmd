This will fill the description of your package.
Fill and run the content of this chunk, before anything else.

# MR-BMA

This function allows the user to pass in a dataframe of harmonized genetic variants, and outputs the results of a Mendelain Randomization Bayesian Model Averaging experiment.

<!-- 
This first section shows:

- the three parts necessary for a package: 'function', 'examples' and 'tests'.  
  + Note that the three following chunks have names accordingly.

-->


<!--
Here is an example on how to use the function.
This should be a reproducible and working example
-->


```{r examples-mr_bma}
lipid_exposures <- TwoSampleMR::mv_extract_exposures(id_exposure = c("ieu-a-299", "ieu-a-300", "ieu-a-302"))
cad_outcome <- TwoSampleMR::extract_outcome_data(snps = lipid_exposures$SNP, outcomes = "ebi-a-GCST005195")
lipids_cad_harmonized <- TwoSampleMR::mv_harmonise_data(lipid_exposures, cad_outcome)
```

<!--
Here are some unit tests to verify the function works as expected.
-->


<!-- 

# Inflate your package

You're one inflate from paper to box.
Build your package from this very Rmd using `fusen::inflate()` 
-->



<!-- 
- Verify your `"DESCRIPTION"` file has been updated
- Verify your function is in `"R/"` directory
- Verify your test is in `"tests/testthat/"` directory
- Verify this Rmd appears in `"vignettes/"` directory
